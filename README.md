## What is iGame?

iGame is a playful web app built with React and Vite, featuring a collection of simple minigames:

- **Letters Game:** Match emojis to their starting letter.
- **Numbers Game:** Practice basic number skills (coming soon).
- **Memory Game:** Test your memory with emoji cards (coming soon).

The app supports English and Spanish, and is designed to be visually engaging and beginner-friendly.

## Project Purpose

This is not a production app—it's a vibe coding experiment. The goal is to learn, have fun, and see what can be built with zero prior JavaScript experience, guided by GPT-4.1.

## How was it built?

- All code, structure, and logic were generated and iterated using GPT-4.1.
- The human collaborator provided ideas, feedback, and tested the app.
- No prior JavaScript or React knowledge was required.

## Running the App

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open your browser to the provided local address.

Enjoy the vibe, experiment, and learn!
